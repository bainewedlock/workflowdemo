## TODO
- identify the user who is resuming / terminating a workflow

## Note 1
- GetWorkflowInstances is marked as obsolete
- I'm still using it is useful and there is no alternative in the API yet
- a workaround could be to bypass the API and access the DB directly
- see https://github.com/danielgerlag/workflow-core/discussions/861

## History
- added client side library @microsoft/signalr
